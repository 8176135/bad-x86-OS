An amalgamation of a bunch of different books, tutorials and modified code by me.

The following directories contain a combination of edited code from different books and tutorials:
- `boot/`
- `cpu/`
- `drivers/`

The following directories contain code that is mostly mine. (Exceptions are mentioned at the top of files):
- `kernel/`
- `libc/`
- `util/`
- `applciation/`
